                Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise as a technology that can be used to improve government
                and economic policy-making. This paper proposes a new research agenda towards this end by
                introducing <strong>Social Environment Design</strong>, a general framework for the use of AI for
                automated
                policy-making that connects with the Reinforcement Learning, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice
                communities.
                The framework seeks to capture general economic environments, includes voting on policy objectives, and
                gives a
                direction for the systematic analysis of government and economic policy through AI simulation. We
                highlight
                key open problems for future research in AI-based policymaking. By solving these challenges, we hope to
                achieve
                various social welfare objectives, thereby promoting more ethical and responsible decision making.

          <div> Economic policy formulation is a domain fraught with complexity, with traditional economic models
            providing limited
            foresight into the outcomes of policy decisions. Policy-makers must not only understand the immediate
            implications
            of individual policies but also their aggregate and long-term effects. In addition, human policy-maker
            incentives
            are often not aligned with the interests of the general public, and may instead prioritize special interests
            or
            reelection. In light of this, AI-based approaches to policy design that can simulate economies and target
            different
            objectives, hold the potential for improved policy understanding and formulation.</div>

            <div>Figure 1: The proposed framework. The process begins with voting, where human or AI players report
              preferences on social welfare objectives to a
              voting mechanism (1). This defines an objective for the Principal, who designs a parameterized 𝑁-player
              Partially Observable Markov Game.
              The players are the same as the voters. This POMG unfolds over several timesteps 𝑇. Following the POMG,
              game state information is extracted
              to initiate a new round of voting, with the last POMG state used as the first game state of the new round.
              This whole process is repeated for
              𝜏 timesteps.</div>

                In an era where AI is gaining increasing attention in governments, it is timely to understand its
                potential influence on future policy-making. Ideally, such a framework should satisfy the following
                desiderata:
              </div>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Alignment of policy-makers</strong> to the values of constituents, whilst ensuring fair and
                  equitable representation.</li>
                <li>Sufficient<strong> model expressivity</strong> to accurately represent the intricate governance
                  structures found in the real world, capturing the subtleties and variances of socio-economic
                  interactions.</li>
                <li>Balance expressiveness with <strong> with computational tractability</strong>, making it feasible to
                  scale to systems with a large number of agents.</li>
                <li>Build<strong> theoretical understanding,</strong> enabling systematic analysis and offering a new
                  lens
                  on complex economic models.</li>
              </ol>
              <div>
                Our work proposes a new framework, Social Environment Design, that lays out an agenda in making progress
                towards these desiderata.
                In our framework, illustrated in the figure above, we suggest addressing the concern of a misaligned
                policy-maker an AI-driven Principal policy-maker
                who seeks to achieve suggested policy goals, given by a voting mechanism. We capture the complexity of a
                general economic environment
                whilst maintaining computational tractability by modeling the economy as a Partially Observable Markov
                Game (POMG), which maintains a fixed
                observation space for each agent. Finally, we structure our framework as repeatedly finding Stackelberg
                Equilbria, enabling theoretical understanding
                by allowing reduction to simpler subproblems.

              (Agapiou et al., 2022).
              Player agents observe a restricted view of their environment, and receive a mixed reward depending on the
              apples they collect and
              the apples their observable neighbors collect. The principal observes both an unrestricted view of the
              environment and the running
              totals of all the players’ cumulative extrinsic rewards, where it collects tax and redistributes wealth on
              the cumulated rewards at
              the end of every tax period (50 timesteps), similar to Zheng et al. (2022). Rewards for the Principal are
              determined by the change
              in value of the objective it is currently assigned by agent votes.</div>

                  In order to give a motivating example for how preference elicitation for the principal in Social
                  Environment Design can be used to align
                  policy-maker incentives, we have created a Sequential Social Dilemma Game inspired by the Harvest
                  Game proposed in Perolat et al. (2017).
                  The game is illustrated in Figure 2. The aim in Harvest Game is to collect apples, with each apple
                  yielding a reward. If all apples in an
                  area are harvested, they never grow back. The dilemma arises when individual self-interest drives
                  rapid harvesting, which could permanently
                  deplete resources. Thus, agents must sacrifice personal benefit and cooperate for collective
                  well-being. One potential solution to this
                  dilemma is through the use of a central government that taxes and redistributes apples. Thus, we
                  have created a new game inspired by
                  Zheng et al. (2022) in which a principal designs tax rates on apple collection and players vote on
                  Utilitarian (productivity) vs.
                  Egalitarian (equality) objectives for the principal. As players interact within this evolving
                  environment, the principal faces the challenge
                  of crafting policies that balance immediate economic incentives with sustainability goals. In order
                  to achieve this, the principal must foster
                  cooperation among players, guiding them towards the Pareto-Efficient equilibrium that the players
                  have chosen. Preliminary results were promising,
                  but further analysis is warranted.

                <div> Our work proposes a generalized framework that has the potential to improve decision-making — we
                  believe that further work will yield tangibly impactful positive results. However, we recognize
                  that its current level of abstraction may obscure its ultimate potential and application. Our
                  motivating example, while useful as a proof of concept, is clearly distant from real-world economic
                  systems. While we recognize the distance, we posit that both a game where agents harvest apples and
                  the NYSE lie on the same fundamental axis. In fact, we outline two natural axes that separate our
                  example from societally impactful instantiations of SED in the future.
                  <br><br>
                  Our axes: <strong>Simulation Complexity</strong> and <strong>Principal Control</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The first and more immediately apparent axis is the complexity of the simulation that the
                      Principal
                      is parameterizing. One of the simplest instantiations of the simulation would be two independent
                      agents
                      harvesting apples, each with the desire to have as many apples as possible. In this situation, an
                      optimal
                      parameterization from the Principal might one that discourages overharvesting such that both
                      agents are able
                      to have more apples in the long term. A more complex instantiation, like our motivating example,
                      contains more
                      agents, with rewards based on social interactions, communal welfare, and varying levels of
                      selfishness. Already,
                      this is closer to the real world. As complexity scales, simulations may approximate economics in
                      self-contained
                      villages, then towns, cities, states, and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The second axis represents the control that the Principal has on the simulation. In this case,
                      potential control
                      is directly proportional to ability. While our motivating example is relatively complex, an
                      advanced Principal
                      with a knowledge of game theory and high-level math would be able to fully ‘solve the game’ by
                      parameterizing the
                      simulation with the mathematically optimal tax rate. In a situation with an obscured or dynamic
                      equilibrium, an
                      advanced Principal may have the ability to output adaptive code designed to produce
                      parameterizations. An even more
                      advanced Principal may output neural network weights for a network designed to produce
                      parameterizations. The relationship
                      between control and ability applies to inputs as well as outputs — a more sophisticated Principal
                      would be able to process
                      more sophisticated information from the agents within the simulation. Thus, as the ability of the
                      Principal increases, the
                      potential for a more effective instantiation of Social Environment Design increases as well.

                    Clearly, we have steps to take in two directions — simulating real-world complexity, and designing
                    an
                    incredibly advanced Principal. Really,
                    we have a marathon to run in two directions — this distance represents a colossal gap between the
                    technology that we have and the technology
                    that we need. Though this gap is large, Rome wasn’t built in a day. We foresee many implementations
                    of SED, each better than the last. Here, we present
                    a
                    simplified outline what some of those
                    implementations may look like.

                      <div><strong>SED v1</strong>: Here, we may see a small population in an already-governed
                        community,
                        such as a neighborhood or a mobile home park, that are
                        looking to improve the place that they live. In this hypothetical, each member of the population
                        donates some small sum of money, along
                        with the changes they wish to see — perhaps a new park, or an after-school organization that
                        looks
                        after children before their parents
                        get home from work. The Principal will take into account their desires, allocate the money as it
                        sees fit, and gauge the satisfaction of
                        the population. The Principal will continue to optimize for the satisfaction of the population
                        over repeated monetary allocations, leading
                        to a happier population. </div>

                        allocation. This may take the form of a larger town or city, in which the Principal deals with
                        both monetary allocation, via taxes rather
                        than donations, and the drafting of legal policies. These legal policies may concern the local
                        tax
                        system itself, the operation of public
                        transport and infrastructure, and more — the Principal would have responsibilities akin to the

                        instantiations for SED grow as well.
                        An advancement from SED v2 may be the utilization of SED within a state in the United States, or
                        for a small small country. Of course,
                        this would be dependent on the success of SED v2, as well as the state of pertinent technology
                        needed for a v3 Principal. This prerequisite
                        applies to each advancement — SED v2 would happen only after the conclusive success of SED v1.

          <div> Economic policy is a very complex field, and current economic models are often unable to accurately
            predict the effects of economic policy decisions. Human policy-makers are tasked with understanding the
            immediate implication of individual policies, but also their long-term effects and their interactions with
            other policies. Furthermore, these policy-makers are often subject to bias from lobbyists or their own

                Figure 1: The proposed framework. In the <strong>Inner Simulation</strong>, there are several players
                in an <strong>environment</strong>.
                You can imagine each player as a simulated person, and the environment to be some video game. Each
                player
                wants to do as well as possible in the game by maximizing their score. After the Inner Simulation has
                run
                for some time, the players vote, giving their preferences on the rules of the game. The Principal takes
                all of these votes, and makes new rules for the game. With the new rules for the game, the Inner
                Simulation runs until it becomes time to vote again. Then, the process continues.
                <br /> <br />
                As an example, let’s picture the Inner Simulation as the game Pac-Man, where Pac-Man and all of the
                ghosts are the players, and the environment is the maze and all of the pellets. It’s important to note
                that no actual people are controlling any of the players — Pac-Man moves around on his own, just like
                the ghosts. Remember that the goal of each player is to get a higher score: Pac-Man gets a higher score
                by eating more pellets, and the ghosts get higher scores by catching Pac-Man. Pac-Man and the ghosts
                play in the Inner Simulation for a while, until it becomes time to vote. At that point, they all report
                their preferences about the Inner Simulation — Pac-Man’s preference might be for more pellets, and
                ghosts might report their preference to be able to move faster. All of these votes are considered by the
                Principal — in this example, we can think of the Principal as the person who coded the Pac-Man game. The
                Principal looks at all of the votes and changes the rules of the Pac-Man game. Then, the new Inner
                Simulation runs again, and the process continues!
                <br />
                As much as we love Pac-Man, the goal of our work is not to better design video games. However, this
                framework is generally applicable. Imagine a small town governed by a mayor. After the election, the
                population of the town would not have guaranteed influence on the actions of the mayor, and instead have
                to trust that the mayor had their best interests at heart. In this scenario, Social Environment Design
                would guarantee that the population had a direct say in the usage of their tax dollars, and know that
                their votes had direct influence in the governance of the town. Beyond eliminating the need for blind
                trust, the Principal has the advantage of being able to consider much more information, and thus be more
                contextualized, than any human.

                When designing this framework, we wanted to try to satisfy several requirements.
              </div>
              <ol>
                <li>First, the framework should ensure the <strong>alignment</strong> of the Principal to the values of
                  the players in
                  the Inner Simulation, with fair and equitable representation.</li>
                <li>We want to be able to <strong>accurately represent</strong> the complicated government and economic
                  structures that
                  we see in the real world today.</li>
                <li>We need the framework to be <strong>efficient</strong> — it takes a lot of computer power
                  (expensive!) to run a
                  framework like this, and we want it to be able to scale to large scenarios. You can think of this like
                  fuel-efficiency — we want our miles-per-gallon to be very high.</li>
                <li>Lastly, we want this framework to help <strong>develop our theoretical understanding</strong> of
                  complex economics. </li>
              </ol>
              <div>
                We argue that Social Environment Design does satisfy these requirements! <strong>Point 1:</strong> In
                our framework,
                illustrated in the figure above, we suggest addressing the concern of alignment by using an Principal
                who seeks to achieve goals that directly stem from votes. The Principal can’t be corrupted by money or
                re-election, unlike many human decision-makers. <strong>Points 2 and 3:</strong> Using some fancy math
                called Game Theory,
                we are able to create a complex environment, but still remain ‘fuel-efficient’ by hiding most of that
                environment from each player (just like you! Most of the world is hidden from you right now; you can’t
                see Antarctica from where you are). <strong>Point 4:</strong> By structuring our framework as repeated
                loops of the same

            <div>This image shows a scene from Harvest Game, an example that we used to demonstrate Social Environment
              Design. This example is more complicated than our earlier Pac-Man example, and is closer to a real-world
              environment.

                  The 7 players in Harvest Game are in a field, surrounded by groups of apples. Each player is able to
                  harvest apples — but if all of the apples in a group are harvested, they never grow back! Remember
                  that each player is looking to get the highest score. In this example, the score is a bit more
                  complicated than Pac-Man and the ghosts. There are two factors that contribute to the score of a
                  player. The first factor is the amount of apples that the player has harvested, and the second is how
                  many apples the other players have harvested. These factors don’t necessarily have equal weight in
                  deciding the score of a player — it depends on how selfish the player is. Different players have
                  different levels of selfishness. Selfish players care more about how many apples they have, and
                  unselfish players care more about how many apples the other players have.
                  <br />
                  In Harvest Game dilemma arises when selfishness drives rapid harvesting, which could permanently
                  deplete resources (remember, when all of the apples in an area are harvested, they never grow back).
                  So, the collective well-being of the population is dependent on individual player sacrificing
                  short-term personal benefit. One potential solution to this dilemma is through the use of a central
                  government (or a Principal!) that taxes and redistributes apples. In Harvest Game, players vote on
                  whether they prefer a utilitarian society (valuing overall productivity) or an egalitarian society
                  (valuing equality). As players interact within this evolving environment, the Principal faces the
                  challenge of crafting tax-rates that balance immediate economic incentives with sustainability goals.
                  In order to achieve this, the Principal must foster cooperation among players, guiding them towards
                  the type of society that the players have chosen. The initial results of Harvest Game using the
                  Principal were promising, but further analysis is warranted.

                <div> Our work proposes a generalized framework that has the potential to improve decision-making, and
                  we believe that further work will yield results that are impactful in the real world. However, we
                  understand that our framework is abstract, and so it may be difficult to see its future potential for
                  application; our Harvest Game example, while useful to demonstrate SED, is still clearly distant from
                  real-world economic systems. While we recognize the distance, we argue that Harvest Game lies on the
                  same fundamental axis as the New York Stock Exchange. In fact, we outline two clear axes that separate
                  our example from societally impactful uses of SED in the future.
                  <br><br>
                  Our axes: <strong>Simulation Complexity</strong> and <strong>Principal Ability</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The first and more immediately apparent axis is the complexity of the simulation (or real world
                      environment). As an example, a simpler instance of Harvest Game would be two selfish players
                      harvesting apples, each having a score that is maximized solely by increasing their own apples. In
                      this situation, the best rules drafted by the Principal might discourage overharvesting of the
                      apples so that both players are able to have more apples in the long term. A more complex
                      instance,
                      like the Harvest Game that we explained, contains more players, with scores decided by individual
                      wealth (apples), communal welfare, and varying levels of selfishness. Already, this is closer to
                      the real world. As complexity scales, simulations may approximate economics in self-contained
                      villages, then towns, cities, states, and so on. </li>
                    <li>
                      The second axis represents the ability of the Principal to preside over complex environments. In
                      the last ten years, artificial intelligence has advanced exponentially (ChatGPT, as you know it
                      today, was almost unthinkable a decade ago!). However, there is still significant progress to be
                      made. We are still far from the technology that would enable artificial intelligence to play the
                      role of Principal for even a small town. As we continue along this path of advancement, however,
                      the potential Principals will be able to effectively participate in more complex real-world
                      environments.
                      </br>
                      While our Harvest Game example is fairly complex, an advanced Principal with a knowledge of game
                      theory and high-level math would be able to fully ‘solve the game’ by coming up with the
                      mathematically optimal tax rate. As environments increase in complexity and become more dynamic,
                      there might not be an optimal ‘solution’ that stays the same. A more advanced Principal may have
                      the ability to create adaptive code that can handle these dynamic situations and still produce .
                      This relationship between control and ability applies to inputs as well as outputs — a more
                      sophisticated Principal would be able to process more sophisticated information from the players
                      in the form of voting. This means that decisions from the Prinicpal will be better contextualized
                      and informed. So, as the ability of the Principal increases, it is able to make better rules for
                      more complex scenarios.

                    Clearly, we have steps to take in two directions — simulating real-world complexity, and designing
                    an incredibly advanced Principal. Really, we have a marathon to run in two directions — this
                    distance represents a colossal gap between the technology that we have and the technology that we
                    need. Though this gap is large, Rome wasn’t built in a day. We foresee many implementations of SED,
                    each better than the last. Here, we present a simplified outline what some of those implementations
                    may look like.

                        <strong>SED v1</strong>: Here, we may see a small population in an already-governed community,
                        such as a neighborhood or a mobile home park, that are looking to improve the place that they
                        live. In this hypothetical, each member of the population donates some small sum of money, and
                        provide with the changes they wish to see — perhaps a new park, or an after-school
                        organization
                        that looks after children before their parents get home from work. The Principal will take
                        into
                        account their desires, allocate the money as it sees fit, and gauge the satisfaction of the
                        population. The Principal will continue to optimize for the satisfaction of the population
                        over
                        repeated monetary allocations, leading to a happier population.

                        allocation. This may take the form of a larger town or city, in which the Principal deals with
                        both monetary allocation, via taxes rather
                        than donations, and the drafting of legal policies. These legal policies may concern the local

        Social Environment Design would not be possible without some exceptional prior work.
        <br />


        Firstly, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01383-x">Human Centered Mechanism Design with
          Democratic AI</a> inspired us to solve the problem of alignment through human feedback, designing policies via
        RLHF. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abk2607">The AI Economist</a> provided
        strong evidence of the ability of AI to outperform other approaches in complex economic policy design. Together,
        these works build the foundation on which we propose Social Environment Design.
        <br /> <br />

        Lastly, we give thanks to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13746">Melting Pot</a>, which allowed us to build
        our motivating example,
        inspired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06600"> Harvest Game</a>.
